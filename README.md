# cursed-emojifier
a deep learning model that combines a face image input with the classified emoji to create a cursed emoji.

this project was completed with the collaboration of three other team members from june 2023 - august 2023.
though there is much to improve for this deep learning model, we have learned a lot throughout this project and are proud of it as our first ML project!

DISCLAIMER: due to github uploading size limitations, the zip files NPU-FER.zip and NewFERPLus.zip were not uploaded to the repo. we will attempt to upload the files in the future but they should also be available online.
